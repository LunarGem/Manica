Basics about mutant psych-based magic.

Source:
psychic energy comes from a psychic's center, a physical depression in the breastbone (level with chest on the outside) that makes the
energy and stores it for use. It also radiates a percentage of this energy in an aura around the psychic, a method through which they can
identify each other.

Usage:
A psychic can use their mind to direct psychic energy into their hands (or not) and then do whatever they like with it. Abilities are varied and almost no two psychics have the same skillset. All of them are capable of telepathy and telekinesis. Skills are generally learned, either by experimentation or by being taught by another psychic.
